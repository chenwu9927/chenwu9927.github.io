The Impact of Momentum Changes in Tennis</h1><ul><li><strong>Problem Chosen</strong>: C</li><li><strong>2024 MCM&#x2F;ICM Summary Sheet</strong></li><li><strong>Team Control Number</strong>: 2430080</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>In an intense tennis match, even a world-renowned and experienced veteran may fail to grasp a momentary reversal and lose. Therefore, identifying factors affecting match points and situation changes, and verifying the potential impact of momentum, is crucial for athletes to better manage matches and refine their strategies. This paper addresses this by constructing models to quantify player performance and momentum, and to analyze how various factors influence game situations.</p><p>Before modeling, we preprocess the annexed Wimbledon match data, identifying and normalizing relevant factors for subsequent quantification.</p><p>For Problem 1, as an initial step, we identify performance-related factors, build a corresponding model, and visualize athlete performance throughout the game. We test several classification models, selecting the best one based on accuracy, recall, precision, and other metrics, followed by performance visualization.</p><p>Problem 2 primarily quantifies “momentum,” transforming it from a theoretical concept into a practical index. We compare this index with previous game results to determine if “momentum” is random. The entropy weight method is used to determine the weight of each variable affecting momentum, followed by Spearman correlation analysis to assess momentum’s influence on the game. Additionally, S-W and K-S tests are performed on the index to determine if game swings and successes are random. The fact that selected variables do not satisfy random distribution further supports a non-random, albeit weak ($0.334$ correlation), influence of “momentum” on game outcomes, refuting the coach’s skepticism.</p><p>For Problem 3, the focus is on modeling game fluctuation. Building on the previous two problems, logistic regression is used to identify performance function conversion points, pinpointing key moments of situation change. The KNN method and BP neural network provide supporting evidence. The model’s effectiveness is cross-verified using multi-set match data. The most relevant factors are determined using combined metrics from the first two problems, and a correlation heatmap is presented. Recommendations derived from these metrics aim to provide insights into player momentum changes in different match situations and support future strategic planning.</p><p>For Problem 4, the logistic regression model generally predicts game fluctuation well. We explore the model’s generalization and limitations from a variable selection perspective, considering metrics overlooked in other models, and propose potential improvements. For instance, enhancing generalization could make the model effective across different competitive sports, aiding athletes’ long-term preparation and physical health.</p><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Machine Learning, Momentum, Correlation Analysis, Entropy Weighting Method, Logistic Regression</p><hr><h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1 Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2><h3 id="1-1-Background"><a href="#1-1-Background" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Background"></a>1.1 Background</h3><p>Tennis, a sport demanding endurance, speed, and comprehensive athletic ability, has a rich history. Elite players like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal combine quick reflexes and explosive power with stamina and stability. Explosiveness and quick reflexes ensure optimal positioning and decision-making for every shot. Endurance and muscle stability enable sustained high-intensity play while reducing injury risk. As a new generation of high-level players emerges and older champions age, there’s growing interest in whether “momentum” influences game trends, potentially mitigating physical decline or enabling tactical development to defeat opponents. Our team addresses this by processing known data, characterizing and correlating indicators, applying principal component analysis where suitable, and using machine learning to build models and draw conclusions. We use data from the initial games of the provided dataset, focusing on indicators such as serve, receive, score, and unforced errors.</p><h3 id="1-2-Restatement-of-the-Problem"><a href="#1-2-Restatement-of-the-Problem" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Restatement of the Problem"></a>1.2 Restatement of the Problem</h3><p>Currently, the existence, quantification, and impact of an abstract indicator like “momentum” remain unclear, particularly how various game events create or change it. This article aims to optimize understanding by addressing the following problems:</p><ol><li>Analyze the game’s flow to determine when and to what extent a player performs better, establish evaluation criteria, and plot the player’s score curve.</li><li>Assess whether the model obtained is random or demonstrates a significant relationship with “momentum,” thereby addressing coach skepticism.</li><li>Identify moments when game momentum shifts between players and provide advice based on these insights.</li><li>Evaluate the model’s applicability and limitations.</li></ol><h2 id="2-Overview-of-basic-definitions"><a href="#2-Overview-of-basic-definitions" class="headerlink" title="2 Overview of basic definitions"></a>2 Overview of basic definitions</h2><h3 id="2-1-Rules-of-Tennis"><a href="#2-1-Rules-of-Tennis" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Rules of Tennis"></a>2.1 Rules of Tennis</h3><p>Tennis rules are complex, especially Grand Slam men’s singles scoring. A match is best-of-five sets. A set typically involves winning 6 games, but requires a two-game lead (e.g., 7-5 or tie-break at 6-6). In a game, a player needs four points to win, also with a two-point lead. Point scores are:</p><ol><li>0 points &#x3D; love</li><li>1 point &#x3D; 15</li><li>2 points &#x3D; 30</li><li>3 points &#x3D; 40</li></ol><p>At $40-40$ (“Deuce”), a player must win two consecutive points to secure the game. Winning the first point gives “AD-in,” and winning the next wins the game. Losing the point returns the score to $40-40$.</p><p>Serve is critical and requires separate analysis. Players alternate serving each game, with two service attempts per point. Failing to land the ball in the service area on both attempts results in a “double fault,” costing the server the point.</p><h3 id="2-2-the-“Momentum”-theory"><a href="#2-2-the-“Momentum”-theory" class="headerlink" title="2.2 the “Momentum” theory"></a>2.2 the “Momentum” theory</h3><p>The “momentum” theory posits that in sports, gaining an advantage often leads to sustained success. This momentum can boost an athlete’s or team’s confidence and may also affect the opponent’s mental state.</p><p>In tennis, an athlete who gains an advantage often maintains it, exerting psychological pressure on the opponent. This psychological edge can simultaneously motivate the advantaged player, leading to positive outcomes.</p><p>Beyond psychological factors like self-confidence and opponent pressure, “momentum” can also be generated through strategic game management, such such as physical energy conservation or adapting to an opponent’s playing style.</p><h3 id="2-3-Model-Overview"><a href="#2-3-Model-Overview" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Model Overview"></a>2.3 Model Overview</h3><p>The overall architecture of our model involves a three-fold task: constructing a model to quantify player performance at any given moment; modeling momentum and investigating its role in game swings and success; and applying the proposed model to a given match to test its performance.</p><p>Our methodology proceeds as follows: First, we preprocess the dataset and select&#x2F;construct $14$ variables for modeling. Among several methods, the XGBoost classification model was chosen for its superior predictive performance. The trained model predicts whether a player will perform well or poorly at a given moment based on these $14$ variables. Second, to analyze momentum’s potential impact on game trends, we select six key variables to construct the momentum function. We use the entropy weighting method to determine variable weights by calculating their influence on game scores. Additionally, S-W and K-S tests are performed on these indicators to determine if game swings and successes are random. Third, building on the first two steps, logistic regression is used to identify critical thresholds in the performance function. This helps pinpoint specific moments of situation shifts, which, combined with player momentum changes, determine the dominant side. Finally, the constructed model undergoes comprehensive analysis, validation, and evaluation.</p><h3 id="2-4-Research-Significance"><a href="#2-4-Research-Significance" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Research Significance"></a>2.4 Research Significance</h3><p>By establishing relevant models, this paper investigates the mechanisms behind phenomena in tennis matches, such as unexpected comebacks despite significant disadvantages. We identify and quantify momentum as an indicator, analyzing key nodes of rhythm reversal. This understanding can help tennis players and coaches adjust their states and strategies in rapidly changing matches, leveraging momentum to overcome opponents even when technical conditions are similar.</p><h2 id="3-Model-hypothesis-and-symbol-description"><a href="#3-Model-hypothesis-and-symbol-description" class="headerlink" title="3 Model hypothesis and symbol description"></a>3 Model hypothesis and symbol description</h2><h3 id="3-1-Basic-assumptions-of-the-model"><a href="#3-1-Basic-assumptions-of-the-model" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Basic assumptions of the model"></a>3.1 Basic assumptions of the model</h3><ol><li>A player’s performance level (skill) is assumed to be constant, unaffected by factors like fatigue, injury, off-field conditions, or natural elements.

The ROC curve, which plots sensitivity against specificity, serves as a comprehensive metric for continuous variables; a larger Area Under the Curve (AUC) signifies higher diagnostic accuracy. The point on the ROC curve closest to the upper-left corner indicates the optimal critical value for achieving both high sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>The evaluation criteria for AUC values in model performance are:</p><ol><li>$AUC &#x3D; 1$: A perfect classifier, implying at least one threshold yields perfect prediction.

When tested with the final $1108$ data points from the standardized dataset, the XGBoost model maintained high prediction accuracy, consistently around $76%$.

To account for varying time intervals between points and to achieve a smoother representation of player performance, we used cubic spline interpolation to interpolate the output and normalize the final results. Additionally, player service status (independent variable $X_5$, where $0$ means no and $1$ means yes) was integrated into the model.

We identify indicators likely to influence player mentality and morale. The momentum function can be expressed as:</p><p>$$ M_t &#x3D; \sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m \beta_i q_i x_i $$<br>where $X \in {X_{7}, X_{8}, X_{9}, X_{10}, X_{15}, X_{16}}$.</p><p>Here, $\beta$ represents the weight of each indicator in momentum, and $q$ signifies the impact of changes in that variable on the game. The entropy weight method is used to determine $\beta$ and $q$. This involves analyzing overall game data, identifying score changes within specific game sections, and counting indicator occurrences to calculate $q$.</p><h4 id="6-2-1-Entropy-weight-method"><a href="#6-2-1-Entropy-weight-method" class="headerlink" title="6.2.1 Entropy weight method"></a>6.2.1 Entropy weight method</h4><p>The entropy weight method, a multi-attribute decision analysis technique, determines attribute influence weights on the final result based on information entropy. It calculates the importance of each attribute by assessing its entropy.</p><p>The principle of the entropy weight method is as follows: Information entropy measures an indicator’s dispersion. Greater dispersion leads to a smaller information entropy value and a larger influence (weight) on the comprehensive evaluation. Conversely, if an indicator’s values are uniform, it holds no role in the comprehensive evaluation. Therefore, information entropy provides an objective basis for calculating index weights in multi-indicator evaluations.</p><p>This method determines weights directly from the data, ensuring strong objectivity and minimizing subjective influence on decision results. Its calculation logic is simple and clear, making it effective and easy to implement.</p><p>For analysis, we selected six indicators: $X_7$ (points scored on non-touch forehand shots in the current set), $X_8$ (points scored on non-touch backhand shots in the current set), $X_9$ (whether the second serve is a double fault), $X_{10}$ (net points won), $X_{15}$ (unforced errors), and $X_{16}$ (whether the current point is ahead of the opponent). We believe these indicators, encompassing both positive and negative influences, significantly impact momentum.</p><p>The specific calculation steps are: First, we construct the index system and determine the index matrix, where each column is an indicator and each row represents an individual’s value across different indicators. With six indicators and six individuals, the matrix is then standardized—a step already completed during data preprocessing. Finally, the entropy ($H_j$) for each index is calculated using the following formulas:</p><p>$$ P_{ij} &#x3D; \frac{Z_{ij}}{\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m Z_{ij}} $$<br>$$ H_j &#x3D; -\frac{\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m P_{ij} \ln(P_{ij})}{\ln m} $$</p><p>Finally, the entropy weight ($w_j$) is calculated using the entropy value: $w_j &#x3D; \frac{1-H_j}{n-\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^n H_j}$. The final values obtained for each weight are $26.274, 33.962, 0.176, 26.896, 1.406, 11.287$. These results are then substituted into the momentum function expression.</p><h4 id="6-2-2-Calculate-the-impact-of-each-indicator-on-the-match-during-the-match"><a href="#6-2-2-Calculate-the-impact-of-each-indicator-on-the-match-during-the-match" class="headerlink" title="6.2.2 Calculate the impact of each indicator on the match during the match"></a>6.2.2 Calculate the impact of each indicator on the match during the match</h4><p>This step aims to determine $q$. The primary operation involves selecting a dataset and calculating the average impact of score changes compared to the operation of that step. For example, if a score changes by $5$ points and occurs $5$ times, the corresponding $q$ value is calculated as the average value: $579&#x2F;577 &#x3D; 1$, $273&#x2F;273 &#x3D; 1$, $-122&#x2F;122 &#x3D; 1$, $545&#x2F;545 &#x3D; 1$, $-920&#x2F;920 &#x3D; -1$, $-152&#x2F;2462 &#x3D; -0.0617$. Based on $\beta$ and $q$, the current momentum change ($M_t$) can be calculated.</p><h3 id="6-3-Find-the-final-momentum-function"><a href="#6-3-Find-the-final-momentum-function" class="headerlink" title="6.3 Find the final momentum function"></a>6.3 Find the final momentum function</h3><p>The model is defined as:<br>$$ \text{Model} :&#x3D; \alpha + I_t I_{(t-1)} M_t $$<br>Here, $\alpha$ represents the correlation between the momentum of the previous time period and the momentum of the later time period. Each score moment is treated as a unit, and momentum changes approximate the relationship between momentum functions. The result of the above expression is approximately $0.1$, suggesting $\alpha \approx 0.1$. Substituting this value allows derivation of the momentum function.</p><p>The visualization demonstrates a clear positive correlation between the momentum function and the performance function during certain stages of representation.</p><h3 id="6-4-Result-analysis-of-question-2"><a href="#6-4-Result-analysis-of-question-2" class="headerlink" title="6.4 Result analysis of question 2"></a>6.4 Result analysis of question 2</h3><p>A Pearson correlation test was conducted between the momentum function and the predicted performance value from Problem 1 to assess momentum’s influence on the game.</p><p><strong>Table 3: Correlation Analysis between Performance and Momentum</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th align="left"></th><th align="left">Performance</th><th align="left">Momentum</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Performance</td><td align="left">1 ($0.000^{***}$)</td><td align="left">($0.000 \times 0.336^{**}$)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Momentum</td><td align="left">($0.000 \times 0.336^{**}$)</td><td align="left">1 ($0.000^{***}$)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Pearson correlation coefficient is $0.335$, indicating a weak correlation between the momentum function and the original performance function. This suggests that while momentum has a certain influence on the game result, it is not random, contrary to the coach’s assertion.</p><h4 id="6-4-1-Normalty-Test"><a href="#6-4-1-Normalty-Test" class="headerlink" title="6.4.1 Normalty Test"></a>6.4.1 Normalty Test</h4><p>To further validate that “momentum” influences game outcomes and to refute the coach’s skepticism, we performed normality tests.</p><p>Given that the momentum function is composed of selected indicators, its random distribution can be approximated as normal.</p><p>Normality testing, primarily conducted using the S-W and K-S tests, assesses whether selected independent variables conform to a normal distribution by analyzing their statistical significance. If the significance ($p &lt; 0.05$), the variable does not meet the normal distribution assumption.</p><p>Taking $X_7$ as an example, with a sample size $N \ge 5000$, the K-S test yielded a significance $p$-value of $0.000^{***}$. This significant result rejects the null hypothesis, indicating that the data for $X_7$ does not follow a normal distribution. Further analysis confirms this, as its kurtosis ($7.673$) is less than $10$ and its skewness ($3.11$) is greater than $3$, consistent with deviations from normality.</p><p>Since other indicators also failed the normality test, this collective evidence refutes the coach’s assertion that “momentum” is random, strongly suggesting that “momentum” indeed impacts the game.</p><h2 id="7-Task-3-Model-Establishment-and-Solution"><a href="#7-Task-3-Model-Establishment-and-Solution" class="headerlink" title="7 Task 3 Model Establishment and Solution"></a>7 Task 3 Model Establishment and Solution</h2><h3 id="7-1-Solution-to-Problem-3"><a href="#7-1-Solution-to-Problem-3" class="headerlink" title="7.1 Solution to Problem 3"></a>7.1 Solution to Problem 3</h3><p>Building on the conclusions from the first two problems, Problem 3 approaches game dynamics from two angles. First, by using the performance function from Problem 1, we identify specific moments of situation change, reflecting the actual competition. Second, from the perspective of momentum, a positive increase in the momentum change of the two players indicates an advantage for Player 1 during that period, and vice versa. Thus, the model can effectively identify these shifts in the game’s flow.</p><h3 id="7-2-Modeling-and-solution-of-problem-3"><a href="#7-2-Modeling-and-solution-of-problem-3" class="headerlink" title="7.2 Modeling and solution of problem 3"></a>7.2 Modeling and solution of problem 3</h3><p>To address this problem, we develop the model using two distinct approaches: first, predicting situation changes through logical analysis; second, analyzing game fluctuations by combining performance and momentum functions from the first two problems to assess game flow.</p><h4 id="7-2-1-Logistic-regression"><a href="#7-2-1-Logistic-regression" class="headerlink" title="7.2.1 Logistic regression"></a>7.2.1 Logistic regression</h4><p>Logistic regression, a generalized linear regression model, differs from linear regression mainly in its dependent variable type; it is suited for binomial distributions, making it primarily a classification method for two-category problems. The process involves establishing a cost function for regression or classification, iteratively solving for optimal model parameters, and then validating the model’s quality. Logistic regression excels at fitting certain linear relationships, offers fast computation, strong noise immunity, and robustness against outliers.</p><p>For our normalized data, we apply logistic regression to determine the median of the performance function. Values above this median indicate Player 1’s advantage, and vice versa. Variables $X_1$ to $X_{14}$ are used as logistic regression inputs, with the momentum increment at each time point as the dependent variable. If this increment is greater than $0$ (occurring in approximately $47%$ of instances), Player 1 holds the advantage. $80%$ of the data is used for training.</p><p><strong>Table 5: Logistic Regression Model Performance on Training and Test Sets</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th align="left">Dataset</th><th align="left">Accuracy Rate</th><th align="left">Recall Rate</th><th align="left">Precision Rate</th><th align="left">F1 Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Training Set</td><td align="left">0.746</td><td align="left">0.746</td><td align="left">0.743</td><td align="left">0.739</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Test Set</td><td align="left">0.708</td><td align="left">0.708</td><td align="left">0.785</td><td align="left">0.679</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To verify the model’s accuracy, we also employed KNN classification and BP neural networks, which yielded the following respective conclusions:</p><p><strong>Table 6: KNN Model Performance on Training and Test Sets</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th align="left">Dataset</th><th align="left">Accuracy Rate</th><th align="left">Recall Rate</th><th align="left">Precision Rate</th><th align="left">F1 Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Training Set</td><td align="left">0.877</td><td align="left">0.877</td><td align="left">0.876</td><td align="left">0.876</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Test Set</td><td align="left">0.694</td><td align="left">0.694</td><td align="left">0.706</td><td align="left">0.685</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table 7: BP-NN Model Performance on Training and Test Sets</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th align="left">Dataset</th><th align="left">Accuracy Rate</th><th align="left">Recall Rate</th><th align="left">Precision Rate</th><th align="left">F1 Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Training Set</td><td align="left">0.746</td><td align="left">0.746</td><td align="left">0.743</td><td align="left">0.740</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Test Set</td><td align="left">0.708</td><td align="left">0.708</td><td align="left">0.785</td><td align="left">0.679</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Logistic regression demonstrates strong performance in both accuracy and precision, aiding in more accurate judgments of the game situation.</p><h4 id="7-2-2-Identify-the-most-relevant-factors"><a href="#7-2-2-Identify-the-most-relevant-factors" class="headerlink" title="7.2.2 Identify the most relevant factors"></a>7.2.2 Identify the most relevant factors</h4><p>The game is analyzed using performance and momentum functions as key factors for correlation assessment. Model analysis results are statistically significant ($p &lt; 0.05$), indicating the model meets requirements. Additionally, VIF indices below $10$ confirm no multicollinearity issues, ensuring a well-constructed model. The game can be approximated by the equation:<br>$$ y &#x3D; 0.09 + 0.708 \times \text{PredictedValue} + 0.41 \times \text{Momentum} $$<br>Ranking indicators by relevance, $X_5$ (server) and $X_{10}$ (net points won) emerge as the most significant factors.

If the opponent scores consecutive winning points, a timely pause (e.g., medical timeout, coaching break) should be utilized to disrupt their rhythm.</li></ol><h2 id="8-Task-4-Model-Analysis"><a href="#8-Task-4-Model-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="8 Task 4 Model Analysis"></a>8 Task 4 Model Analysis</h2><h3 id="8-1-Model-Testing"><a href="#8-1-Model-Testing" class="headerlink" title="8.1 Model Testing"></a>8.1 Model Testing</h3><p>For model testing, we use the Problem 1 model. The independent variable data from Carlos Alcaraz’s match against Daniil Medvedev (2023-wimbledon-1601) serves as the test set, while other datasets are used for training, with Player 1 remaining the primary observation.</p><p>The prediction effect is evaluated as follows:</p><p><strong>Table 8: Performance Metrics on Test Set</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th align="left">Dataset</th><th align="left">Accuracy</th><th align="left">Recall</th><th align="left">Precision</th><th align="left">F1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Test set</td><td align="left">0.962</td><td align="left">0.978</td><td align="left">0.957</td><td align="left">0.966</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A visual comparison between actual and predicted values shows a high prediction accuracy.
