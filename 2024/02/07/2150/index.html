Therefore, identifying factors affecting match points and situation changes, and verifying the potential impact of momentum, is crucial for athletes to better manage matches and refine their strategies. This paper addresses this by constructing models to quantify player performance and momentum, and to analyze how various factors influence game situations.</p><p>Before modeling, we preprocess the annexed Wimbledon match data, identifying and normalizing relevant factors for subsequent quantification.</p><p>For Problem 1, as an initial step, we identify performance-related factors, build a corresponding model, and visualize athlete performance throughout the game. We test several classification models, selecting the best one based on accuracy, recall, precision, and other metrics, followed by performance visualization.</p><p>Problem 2 primarily quantifies “momentum,” transforming it from a theoretical concept into a practical index. We compare this index with previous game results to determine if “momentum” is random. The entropy weight method is used to determine the weight of each variable affecting momentum, followed by Spearman correlation analysis to assess momentum’s influence on the game. Additionally, S-W and K-S tests are performed on the index to determine if game swings and successes are random. The fact that selected variables do not satisfy random distribution further supports a non-random, albeit weak ($0.334$ correlation), influence of “momentum” on game outcomes, refuting the coach’s skepticism.</p><p>For Problem 3, the focus is on modeling game fluctuation. Building on the previous two problems, logistic regression is used to identify performance function conversion points, pinpointing key moments of situation change. The KNN method and BP neural network provide supporting evidence. The model’s effectiveness is cross-verified using multi-set match data. The most relevant factors are determined using combined metrics from the first two problems, and a correlation heatmap is presented. Recommendations derived from these metrics aim to provide insights into player momentum changes in different match situations and support future strategic planning.</p><p>For Problem 4, the logistic regression model generally predicts game fluctuation well. We explore the model’s generalization and limitations from a variable selection perspective, considering metrics overlooked in other models, and propose potential improvements. For instance, enhancing generalization could make the model effective across different competitive sports, aiding athletes’ long-term preparation and physical health.</p><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Machine Learning, Momentum, Correlation Analysis, Entropy Weighting Method, Logistic Regression</p><hr><h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1 Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2><h3 id="1-1-Background"><a href="#1-1-Background" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Background"></a>1.1 Background</h3><p>Tennis, a sport demanding endurance, speed, and comprehensive athletic ability, has a rich history. Elite players like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal combine quick reflexes and explosive power with stamina and stability. Explosiveness and quick reflexes ensure optimal positioning and decision-making for every shot. Endurance and muscle stability enable sustained high-intensity play while reducing injury risk. As a new generation of high-level players emerges and older champions age, there’s growing interest in whether “momentum” influences game trends, potentially mitigating physical decline or enabling tactical development to defeat opponents. Our team addresses this by processing known data, characterizing and correlating indicators, applying principal component analysis where suitable, and using machine learning to build models and draw conclusions. We use data from the initial games of the provided dataset, focusing on indicators such as serve, receive, score, and unforced errors.</p><h3 id="1-2-Restatement-of-the-Problem"><a href="#1-2-Restatement-of-the-Problem" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Restatement of the Problem"></a>1.2 Restatement of the Problem</h3><p>Currently, the existence, quantification, and impact of an abstract indicator like “momentum” remain unclear, particularly how various game events create or change it. This article aims to optimize understanding by addressing the following problems:</p><ol><li>Analyze the game’s flow to determine when and to what extent a player performs better, establish evaluation criteria, and plot the player’s score curve.</li><li>Assess whether the model obtained is random or demonstrates a significant relationship with “momentum,” thereby addressing coach skepticism.</li><li>Identify moments when game momentum shifts between players and provide advice based on these insights.</li><li>Evaluate the model’s applicability and limitations.</li></ol><h2 id="2-Theoretical-Foundations-and-Conceptual-Definitions"><a href="#2-Theoretical-Foundations-and-Conceptual-Definitions" class="headerlink" title="2 Theoretical Foundations and Conceptual Definitions"></a>2 Theoretical Foundations and Conceptual Definitions</h2><p>This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and key concepts underpinning our research.

Tennis scoring is hierarchical, progressing from points to games, sets, and finally the match.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="left">Level</th><th align="left">Winning Condition</th><th align="left">Scoring System &amp; Key Rules</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><strong>Point</strong></td><td align="left">The basic scoring unit.</td><td align="left">A player wins a point if the opponent fails to return the ball legally.</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><strong>Game</strong></td><td align="left">Win at least 4 points with a 2-point lead.</td><td align="left">Points are called “Love” (0), “15”, “30”, “40”.<br>If the score is 40-40 (“Deuce”), a player must win two consecutive points.

A server has two attempts per point. A failed first attempt is a “fault”. A failed second attempt is a “double fault”, and the server loses the point.</p><h3 id="2-2-Sports-Momentum-Theory-Framework"><a href="#2-2-Sports-Momentum-Theory-Framework" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Sports Momentum Theory Framework"></a>2.2 Sports Momentum Theory Framework</h3><p>Momentum in sports is a complex psychological and physiological phenomenon where success (or failure) tends to perpetuate itself.

This not only helps in winning points directly but also serves as a primary engine for building positive momentum.</p></li><li><p><strong>Control the Net</strong>: Winning points at the net has a disproportionately large impact on momentum. Players should practice their net-play (volleys, smashes) and look for strategic opportunities to approach the net and finish points aggressively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cultivate Weaponry and Disrupt Rhythm</strong>: The importance of backhand winners ($X_8$) highlights the value of developing powerful groundstrokes. When an opponent builds momentum through consecutive winning points, a player should consider using a tactical pause (e.g., a medical timeout if legitimate, or slowing the pace between points) to disrupt their rhythm and reset the psychological dynamic.</p></li></ol><h2 id="7-Model-Robustness-and-Generalization-Analysis"><a href="#7-Model-Robustness-and-Generalization-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="7.
